    The Open Text Web Solutions Usergroup e.V. (OWUG) was founded in February 2002 on the initiative of users and specialists and created a manufacturer-independent information forum. End users and partners have come together. In order to quickly expand their respective know-how through an intensive exchange of experience. And to promote the successful use of OpenText™ Web Site Management. Prior to the takeover of RedDot Solutions AG by OpenText™, the association was called RedDot Usergroup e.V. (RDUG).
